\section{Introduction}
Efficient vehicle transportation is important for timely deliveries for building the trust of customers in any organization. Many Origanizations still rely on manual system of tracking records for vehical transportation which leads to many complications including risks of lost of data , waste of time ,difficuly in keeping billing records ,duplication of data and also mismanagement of tracking of orders. To configure all these issues , we are building a computarized transport management system to track orders in real time, keep all the documentation records digitally, generate payments easily , to scale the buisiness across other countries and to increase productivity. This will increase co-ordination among stakeholders and build trust among customers.
