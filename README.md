## **Project Overview**

The **Vehicle Transport Management System (VTMS)** is a web-based software solution designed to automate and manage vehicle transportation operations. The system replaces manual record-keeping with a computerized platform that supports vehicle booking, shipment tracking, billing, payments, and administrative management. VTMS improves efficiency, reduces errors, enhances customer trust, and ensures real-time coordination among stakeholders.

# **Milestone 1 : Requirements Gathering**

## **1. Introduction**

Efficient vehicle transportation is essential for ensuring timely deliveries and maintaining customer trust. Many organizations still rely on manual transportation and billing systems, which lead to data loss, duplication of records, billing confusion, delayed processing, and poor shipment tracking. To address these challenges, VTMS is proposed as a computerized solution that enables real-time tracking, digital record management, automated billing, and improved coordination among all stakeholders.

---

## **2. Problem Statement**

### **2.1 Current Situation**

Most organizations manage vehicle transportation manually. Shipment records, customer data, and billing details are maintained in physical registers, increasing the risk of data loss and inefficiency. There is no real-time tracking system, and payments are handled manually without proper digital receipts.

### **2.2 Identified Problems**

* No real-time vehicle tracking
* High risk of data loss and duplication
* Manual billing and payment confusion
* Poor coordination between departments
* Lack of transparency for customers

### **2.3 Need for the System**

A computerized VTMS is required to:

* Track vehicles in real time
* Digitally manage customer, vehicle, and shipment records
* Automate billing and payment processing
* Generate invoices and receipts
* Improve efficiency and customer satisfaction

---

## **3. Project Objectives**

### **3.1 Main Objective**

To design and develop a computerized Vehicle Transport Management System that resolves the inefficiencies and risks of manual transportation systems.

### **3.2 Specific Objectives**

* Enable real-time vehicle tracking
* Automate shipment scheduling and delivery monitoring
* Maintain a secure digital database
* Automate billing and payment processing
* Improve coordination among customers, transport staff, and administration

---

## **4. User Identification**

### **4.1 Overview**

VTMS serves multiple stakeholders, each interacting with the system differently. Identifying users ensures the system meets functional and operational needs.

### **4.2 Specified Users**

* **Customers:** Book vehicles, track shipments, and make payments
* **Transport Management:** Assign vehicles, track deliveries, and manage operations
* **System Administrators:** Manage users, system data, and security
* **Finance Department:** Handle billing, payments, and financial records
* **Marketing Department:** Analyze service usage and promote transport services

---

## **5. Software Development Methodology**

VTMS follows the **Agile Scrum methodology**, enabling iterative development, regular feedback, and continuous improvement.

### **5.1 Why Agile Scrum**

* Requirements may evolve
* Continuous stakeholder feedback is needed
* Large system divided into manageable sprints
* Frequent testing for tracking and payment modules

### **5.2 Tentative Schedule**

* Requirement gathering
* Sprint planning
* System design and prototyping
* Feature development (tracking, billing, users)
* Integration and testing
* Deployment

---

## **6. Tools and Technologies**

* **Git & GitHub:** Version control and collaboration
* **Figma:** UI/UX design and prototyping
* **LaTeX:** Documentation
* **Adobe Illustrator:** Graphics and design assets

---

## **Requirement Provider Agreement**

The project is developed under a formal **Requirement Provider Agreement** with:

**Requirement Provider:**
Mr. Ahtesham Abdullah
Final-Year Student, Schechian University, China

The agreement defines responsibilities, intellectual property, confidentiality, and delivery terms.
